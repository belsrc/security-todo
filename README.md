# Simple Security .todo

A simple security .todo using the guidelines from [security-guide-for-developers](https://github.com/FallibleInc/security-guide-for-developers) and the Atom package [tasks](https://github.com/irrationalistic/atom-tasks) for easy inclusion in your project.

This was made merely so I could have something in the project and wouldn't have to pull up the repo anytime I needed to check it. Also, if they move to a taxonomy list this will become defunct.
